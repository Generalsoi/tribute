All codes written by me, Sucess Ikhinobele 

I tried to make this site a responsive as possible, and also I'm still working 
on my color wizardry, would get a grasp of it soon. I also implemented sliders 
in the site. 

I did not enounter any difficulties of any kind while completing this site. 

I would love to hear your opinions on how I can improve it as well.
