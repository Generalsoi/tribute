  <section id="info">
    <h2>With a fanbase boasting culture heavyweights like
      Michelle Obama, the Houston rapper is leading a rap renaissance.</h2>
    <p>Tobe Nwigwe is a Houston-based rapper who spreads inspirational, meaningful messages through his music. His self-described aim is to "make purpose popular." He is easily recognizable by his deep yet gentle voice and exceptionally agile rhyming
      style. He is highly prolific, regularly releasing new songs and videos, often co-starring his wife, Ivory Rogers (simply known as Fat), and producer LaNell Grant (aka Nell). His songs have been collected on full-length releases such as 2018's
      The
      Originals.

      Nwigwe, a first generation Nigerian-American, was born in Alief, Texas, a suburb of Houston. He attended the University of North Texas and was a star linebacker on the university's football team, but he left due to a foot injury. He first
      received attention in 2014 for singles such as "Been Grinding" and "Coulda Woulda Shoulda," which appeared on his EP Pardon My Lateness. He became heavily productive in 2017, releasing Tobe from the Swat and two Get Twisted Sundays mixtapes
      over
      the course of the year. Numerous singles and videos appeared throughout 2018; many of the tracks appeared on The Originals and More Originals.</p>
    <p>His community has been a dominant aspect of his ethos ever since the rapper first appeared on the radar in 2017 with his weekly Instagram series, #getTWISTEDsundays. In the simple but intimate videos, Nwigwe would sit on the floor and
      freestyle over classic beats like Tupac’s “Ambitionz Az a Ridah” while his then-girlfriend, now-wife Fat sat above him on the couch, twisting his hair. They weren’t dolled up. There were no fancy filters, no cliché drip — just tube socks,
      slides, and Black love. Beyond being his uniform, these are three things that have, in many ways, epitomized who Nwigwe is as an artist.
